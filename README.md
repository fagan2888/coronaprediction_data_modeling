## Modeling idea:

I got an idea that Spreading virus looks like a social network. The virus is spreading from person-to-person like SNS does.
So I thought that prophet algoritms from Facebook could be useful to predict the future trends.
According to Facebook, Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.
But, there are a few wrong prediction data that are less than former number. These numbers are replace by median number.

## Hope:

I hope the website helps people to guess the number of confirmed cases, recovered patients, and death toll in order to make effective ways to prevent COVID-19 Spread in Communities.
